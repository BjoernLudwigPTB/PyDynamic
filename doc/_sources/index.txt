PyDynamic - Analysis of Dynamic Measurements
============================================

PyDynamic is a Python software package developed jointly by mathematicians from `Physikalisch-Technische
Bundesanstalt <www.ptb.de>`_ (Germany) and `National Physical Laboratory <www.npl.co.uk>`_ (UK) as part of a joint European Research Project.
