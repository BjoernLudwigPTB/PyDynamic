# PyDynamic
Python package for the analysis of dynamic measurements

The goal of this package is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and related areas who deal with time-dependent, i.e. *dynamic*, measurements.
The software is part of a joint research project of the national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e. [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](http://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html)
and the [National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk).

### Installation
If you just want to use the software, the easiest way is to run from your system's command line
```
  pip install PyDynamic
```
This will download the latest version from the Python package repository and copy it into your local folder of third-party libraries. Usage in any Python environment on your computer is then possible by
```python
  import PyDynamic
```
or, for example, for the module containing the Fourier domain uncertainty methods:
```python
  from PyDynamic.uncertainty import propagate_DFT
```
Updates can then be installed via
```
  pip install --upgrade PyDynamic
```

For collaboration we recommend using [Github Desktop](https://desktop.github.com) or any other git-compatible version control software and cloning the repository (https://github.com/eichstaedtPTB/PyDynamic.git). In this way, any updates to the software will be highlighted in the version control software and can be applied very easily.

If you have downloaded this software, we would be very thankful for letting us know. You may, for instance, drop an email to one of the authors (e.g. [Sascha Eichst√§dt](mailto:sascha.eichstaedt@ptb.de) or [Ian Smith](mailto:ian.smith@npl.co.uk) )

### Roadmap - next steps

1. Extend the existing examples using improved signals and systems.
2. Extend the code to more advanced noise processes and uncertainty evaluation.
3. Add IPython notebooks as a way of documentation.
4. Provide graphical user interfaces for specific use cases (Any suggestions? Let us know!)
