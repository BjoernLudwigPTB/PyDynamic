# PyDynamic
Python package for the analysis of dynamic measurements

The goal of this package is to provide a starting point for users in metrology and related areas who deal with time-dependent, i.e. *dynamic*, measurements.
The software is part of a joint research project of the national metrology institutes from Germany and the UK, i.e. [Physikalisch-Technische Bundesanstalt](http://www.ptb.de/cms/en.html)
and the [National Physical Laboratory](http://www.npl.co.uk).

Note that currently this software is written in Python 2.7. The next release will be written in Python 3.5 to ensure future compatibility.

If you have downloaded this software, we would be very thankful for letting us know. You may, for instance, drop an email to one of the authors (e.g. [Sascha Eichst√§dt](mailto:sascha.eichstaedt@ptb.de) )
